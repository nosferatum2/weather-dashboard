# Weather Dashboard

**Objective:** Build a simple weather dashboard application that displays detailed weather information for multiple cities.

## Requirements:

1. **Application Overview:**
  - Create a simple weather dashboard that allows users to add multiple cities and view their current weather conditions.
  - Each city's card should display:
    - City name
    - Current temperature
    - Weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy)
    - Option to remove the city from the dashboard.

2. **Technical Requirements:**
  - Use latest **Angular**
  - Fetch weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
  - Implement the following features:
    - An input field to enter a city name and a button to add it to the dashboard.
    - A display of all added cities, each in its own card.
    - Use **RxJS** to handle API requests and manage the response data.
    - Implement a loading indicator while fetching data.
    - Implement error handling to manage cases where the city is not found.
  - Style the dashboard using **CSS** or **Sass**, ensuring a responsive design.
    Using helper style libraries like Tailwind is allowed.
  - Write unit tests for components and services using **Jasmine/Karma**.

3. **Additional Features (Optional):**
  - Save the list of cities in local storage so that they persist across page refreshes.
  - Allow users to view the forecast for the next few days for each city.
  - Add some fancy animations

4. **Submission:**
  - Use this repo as a starting point for your journey
  - Host the code in a public repository (e.g., GitHub) and provide the link.
  - Include a README file with setup instructions and details on any API keys used.
